# Requirements Traceability Matrix for EduLibra

## Overview
This document provides a high-level traceability matrix linking functional and non-functional requirements to test cases. This ensures that all requirements are tested and validated.

## Matrix

| Requirement ID | Requirement Description                              | Test Case ID | Test Case Description                                                                     |
|----------------|------------------------------------------------------|--------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| FR-001         | User Registration using email                       | TC-001       | Verify that users can register using a valid email and receive a verification email.   |
| FR-002         | Content Upload and Tagging                          | TC-002       | Validate content upload functionality and the ability to add tags and metadata.         |
| FR-003         | Advanced Search Functionality                       | TC-003       | Ensure search functionality returns accurate results based on keywords and filters.     |
| NFR-001        | System Response Time < 2 seconds                    | TC-004       | Measure system response time under normal load conditions.                              |
| NFR-002        | Support for 10,000 concurrent users                 | TC-005       | Load test the system to validate performance under concurrent user access.               |
| NFR-003        | Data Encryption for sensitive information           | TC-006       | Verify encryption of data in transit and at rest using defined encryption standards.     |
| BR-001         | Subscription plan access control                    | TC-007       | Validate that users have appropriate access based on their subscription plan.           |
