# AWS Infrastructure Concept for EduLibra

## Overview
This document outlines the proposed AWS infrastructure for deploying and managing the EduLibra platform, emphasizing scalability and reliability.

## Core AWS Services

| Service Category       | AWS Service                   | Purpose                                                                                   |
|------------------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Compute**            | Amazon EC2, AWS Lambda       | Host application servers and execute serverless functions for scalable compute capacity.  |
| **Storage**            | Amazon S3, Amazon EBS         | Store multimedia content, backups, and persistent application data.                      |
| **Database**           | Amazon RDS (PostgreSQL), Amazon DynamoDB | Manage relational and NoSQL databases for structured and unstructured data.         |
| **Networking**         | Amazon VPC, Amazon CloudFront  | Provide secure and scalable network infrastructure; optimize content delivery globally.   |
| **Security**           | AWS IAM, AWS KMS              | Manage access control and encryption to safeguard platform data and resources.           |
| **Monitoring & Logging**| Amazon CloudWatch, AWS CloudTrail | Monitor system performance, logs, and events for operational insights.               |
| **Container Orchestration**| Amazon ECS, Amazon EKS     | Deploy and manage containerized microservices for agility and scalability.              |

## Deployment Architecture

1. **Multi-Tier Architecture:**
   - Utilize a multi-tier architecture consisting of presentation, application, and data layers for separation of concerns.
   - Deploy presentation layer components on Amazon EC2 instances or AWS Lambda for dynamic content delivery.

2. **Microservices Deployment:**
   - Leverage Amazon ECS or EKS for container orchestration, enabling scalable deployment of microservices.
   - Utilize AWS Fargate for serverless container management, reducing operational overhead.

3. **Data Storage and Management:**
   - Deploy relational databases on Amazon RDS for structured data and Amazon DynamoDB for NoSQL data needs.
   - Utilize Amazon S3 for scalable object storage of multimedia content and backups.
   - Implement Amazon ElastiCache with Redis for caching frequently accessed data.

4. **Content Delivery and Networking:**
   - Use Amazon CloudFront as a content delivery network (CDN) to optimize content delivery and reduce latency globally.
   - Configure Amazon VPC to establish secure and isolated network environments for platform components.

5. **Security and Compliance:**
   - Implement AWS IAM for fine-grained access control and permission management.
   - Utilize AWS KMS for encryption of sensitive data at rest and in transit.
   - Ensure compliance with relevant regulations and standards for data protection and privacy.

6. **Monitoring and Operations:**
   - Deploy Amazon CloudWatch for monitoring system performance, logs, and events.
   - Utilize AWS CloudTrail to track API calls and maintain accountability for actions performed in the AWS environment.
   - Implement automated alerting and response mechanisms to ensure system reliability and availability.

## Scalability and Reliability Features

- **Auto Scaling:**
  - Configure auto-scaling policies for EC2 instances and ECS services to dynamically adjust capacity based on demand.

- **Multi-AZ Deployments:**
  - Deploy critical database and application components across multiple Availability Zones (AZs) for high availability and fault tolerance.

- **Disaster Recovery:**
  - Implement backup and disaster recovery strategies using AWS Backup and Amazon S3 versioning.
  - Establish failover mechanisms and regional redundancy to ensure business continuity in case of outages.

This infrastructure concept leverages AWS services to provide a scalable, reliable, and secure platform for EduLibra, ensuring optimal performance and user experience.
