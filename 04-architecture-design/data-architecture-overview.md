# Data Architecture Overview for EduLibra

## Overview
This document provides an overview of the conceptual data flow and key data entities within the EduLibra platform, ensuring efficient data management and retrieval.

## Data Flow

1. **User Interaction Data:**
   - Captured through user interactions with the platform, including content access, search queries, and engagement metrics.
   - Processed in real-time to generate insights and recommendations.

2. **Content Metadata:**
   - Collected during content upload and management processes, including tags, categories, and author information.
   - Utilized for search optimization and recommendation engine inputs.

3. **System Logs and Events:**
   - Generated by system components to monitor performance, errors, and operational metrics.
   - Aggregated and analyzed for system health monitoring and troubleshooting.

## Key Data Entities

| Entity Name               | Description                                                                             |
|---------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **User**                  | Stores user profiles, roles, preferences, and subscription details.                      |
| **Content**               | Represents learning materials, including metadata, tags, and access permissions.          |
| **Interaction Logs**      | Records user interactions with content and platform features.                           |
| **Subscription**          | Manages subscription plans, payment details, and access rights.                         |
| **Recommendation Model**  | Stores data and models used for generating personalized content recommendations.        |

## Data Storage and Management

- **Relational Database (PostgreSQL):**
  - Stores structured data such as user profiles, subscription details, and content metadata.
  - Supports complex queries and transactions for robust data consistency.

- **NoSQL Database (MongoDB):**
  - Handles unstructured content data, including multimedia files and user-generated content.
  - Provides flexibility and scalability for diverse data types and formats.

- **Data Warehouse:**
  - Aggregates and stores historical data for analytics and reporting purposes.
  - Enables advanced data analysis and business intelligence capabilities.

- **Cache Layer (Redis):**
  - Caches frequently accessed data to enhance system performance and reduce database load.
  - Implements caching strategies to ensure data consistency and responsiveness.

## Data Integration and Processing

- Implement ETL pipelines to extract, transform, and load data from various sources into the data warehouse.
- Utilize stream processing technologies (e.g., Apache Kafka) for real-time data ingestion and processing.
- Ensure data integrity and quality through validation, cleansing, and enrichment processes.
