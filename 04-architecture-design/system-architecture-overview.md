# System Architecture Overview for EduLibra

## Overview
This document provides an overview of the system architecture for EduLibra using a conceptual C4 model. The architecture is designed to ensure scalability, reliability, and seamless integration with existing systems.

## C4 Model Levels

### Level 1: System Context
EduLibra operates as a standalone digital library platform but can integrate with existing Learning Management Systems (LMS), such as Moodle, and third-party content repositories.

### Level 2: Container Diagram
The system is composed of several key containers:

- **Web Application:** Frontend application built with React.js.
- **API Gateway:** Manages requests and directs them to the appropriate microservices.
- **Microservices:**
  - User Service: Manages user profiles and authentication.
  - Content Service: Handles content storage, retrieval, and metadata management.
  - AI Service: Provides recommendations and content tagging capabilities.
  - Subscription Service: Manages subscription plans and payment processing.
- **Database Layer:** Comprises both SQL (PostgreSQL) for structured data and NoSQL (MongoDB) for unstructured content data.
- **Cache Layer:** Redis cache for improving response times for frequently accessed data.
- **Search Engine:** Elasticsearch for efficient content search and retrieval.

### Level 3: Component Diagram (Example for Content Service)
The Content Service includes components for:
- Upload Management: Handles the ingestion and validation of content.
- Metadata Management: Manages tagging, categorization, and indexing of content.
- Content Retrieval: Facilitates search and retrieval operations.

### Level 4: Code Diagram
Detailed diagrams for code-level interactions are maintained within each microservice repository and will be elaborated as development progresses.

## Key Interactions

1. **User Authentication:**
   - Users interact with the web application, which communicates with the User Service for authentication and profile management.

2. **Content Delivery:**
   - User requests for content are routed through the API Gateway to the Content Service, retrieving data from the Database Layer.

3. **AI-Driven Recommendations:**
   - The AI Service processes user behavior and content metadata to generate recommendations, which are then displayed via the web application.

## Deployment Architecture
EducLibra will be deployed on AWS to leverage scalability, reliability, and global reach. Core services will be containerized using Docker and orchestrated via Kubernetes to ensure efficient resource utilization and deployment flexibility.
