# Branching and CI/CD Strategy for EduLibra

## Overview
This document describes the branching strategy and Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline for the EduLibra project.

## Branching Strategy

### GitFlow Model
- **Main Branches:**
  - `main`: Represents the production-ready codebase. All releases are tagged from this branch.
  - `develop`: Serves as the integration branch for features. Code from feature branches is merged here for testing and integration.

- **Supporting Branches:**
  - `feature/*`: Each new feature or enhancement is developed in a dedicated feature branch. These branches are created from `develop` and merged back into it upon completion.
  - `release/*`: Branches for preparing a new production release. Bug fixes and final adjustments are made here before merging into `main` and tagging a release.
  - `hotfix/*`: Used for quick fixes in the production code. These branches are created from `main` and merged back into both `main` and `develop`.

### Workflow
1. Developers create a new feature branch from `develop`.
2. Changes are committed and pushed to the feature branch.
3. A pull request (PR) is created for merging the feature branch into `develop`.
4. Code is reviewed, tested, and merged into `develop` after approval.
5. When `develop` reaches a stable state, a release branch is created for final testing and preparation.
6. The release branch is merged into `main` and tagged as a new release.
7. Hotfixes are created from `main`, addressed, and merged back into both `main` and `develop`.

## CI/CD Pipeline

### Continuous Integration
- **Build Automation:**
  - Use CI tools like Jenkins, GitHub Actions, or GitLab CI to automate the build process.
  - Trigger builds on every commit to feature branches and PRs to `develop`.

- **Automated Testing:**
  - Execute unit tests, integration tests, and static code analysis as part of the CI pipeline.
  - Ensure that all tests pass before merging changes into `develop`.

- **Code Quality Checks:**
  - Implement code quality gates using tools like SonarQube to enforce coding standards and quality metrics.

### Continuous Deployment
- **Staging Environment:**
  - Automate deployment of the `develop` branch to a staging environment for further testing and validation.
  - Use Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) tools like Terraform or AWS CloudFormation to manage staging environments.

- **Production Deployment:**
  - Automate deployment of the `main` branch to production after a release is tagged.
  - Implement blue-green deployment or canary releases to minimize disruption and risk.
  - Use monitoring tools to track deployment health and rollback if issues arise.

- **Rollback Strategy:**
  - Maintain the ability to quickly rollback to a previous stable version in case of deployment failures.
  - Utilize feature flags and gradual release strategies to mitigate risks associated with new releases.
