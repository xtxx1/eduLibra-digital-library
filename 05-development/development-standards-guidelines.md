# Development Standards and Guidelines for EduLibra

## Overview
This document outlines the development standards and guidelines for the EduLibra project. Adherence to these standards ensures code quality, maintainability, and consistency across the codebase.

## Coding Standards

### Language-Specific Guidelines
- **JavaScript/React:**
  - Use ES6+ syntax and functional components in React.
  - Follow Airbnb JavaScript Style Guide for consistent coding practices.
  - Implement PropTypes for component props validation.

- **Python:**
  - Follow PEP 8 guidelines for Python code.
  - Use type hints to improve code readability and maintainability.

- **Backend Services (Node.js/Java):**
  - Follow RESTful API design principles for backend services.
  - Use meaningful HTTP status codes and maintain consistent error handling.

### General Best Practices
- Code should be modular, reusable, and well-documented.
- Avoid long methods/functions; adhere to the Single Responsibility Principle.
- Use meaningful naming conventions for variables, functions, and classes.
- Ensure proper error handling and logging throughout the application.

## Documentation Standards

### Code Documentation
- Include comments for complex logic, algorithms, and non-obvious code sections.
- Use JSDoc for JavaScript and similar documentation formats for other languages.
- Document API endpoints using Swagger/OpenAPI for clear and interactive API documentation.

### Project Documentation
- Keep README files up-to-date with setup instructions, project overview, and contribution guidelines.
- Maintain comprehensive documentation for architecture, deployment, and operational procedures.

## Code Review Process

### Code Review Guidelines
- All code changes must undergo a peer review process before being merged into the main branch.
- Code reviews should focus on functionality, performance, security, and adherence to coding standards.
- Use pull requests (PRs) on Git for submitting changes and conducting code reviews.

### Review Checklist
- Does the code meet the project's coding standards?
- Are there any obvious bugs or inefficiencies?
- Is the code well-documented and understandable?
- Does the code adhere to the project's architectural guidelines and principles?

## Testing Guidelines

### Unit Testing
- Write unit tests for individual functions and components using appropriate testing frameworks (e.g., Jest for JavaScript, PyTest for Python).
- Aim for high test coverage (minimum 80%) for critical components and logic.

### Integration Testing
- Perform integration testing to ensure that different modules and services work together as expected.
- Use tools like Postman or automated test scripts to validate API endpoints and interactions.

### End-to-End Testing
- Conduct end-to-end testing to validate complete user workflows and scenarios.
- Utilize testing frameworks such as Cypress or Selenium for web application testing.

## Version Control and Branching Strategy

### Git Workflow
- Follow the GitFlow branching model for managing code branches.
- Maintain separate branches for features, releases, and hotfixes.
- Perform regular merges and rebase operations to keep branches up-to-date with the main branch.
