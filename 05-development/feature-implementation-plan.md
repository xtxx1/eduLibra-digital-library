# Feature Implementation Plan for EduLibra

## Overview
This document outlines a plan for implementing a specific feature in the EduLibra platform. For this example, we focus on the "Personalized Learning Paths" feature.

## Feature Overview
The Personalized Learning Paths feature will allow users to create and follow custom learning paths tailored to their educational goals and interests.

## Objectives
- Enable users to create custom learning paths by selecting and sequencing content.
- Provide recommendations for content to include in a learning path based on user preferences and goals.
- Track user progress through learning paths and provide completion certificates.

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Requirements Analysis
- Collaborate with stakeholders to gather and refine requirements for the feature.
- Define user stories, acceptance criteria, and priority levels for feature components.
- Create wireframes and mockups to visualize the user interface and experience.

### Phase 2: System Design
- Design database schema for storing learning paths, user progress, and associated metadata.
- Define API endpoints and data models for managing learning paths and content associations.
- Develop UI components and flows for creating, editing, and viewing learning paths.

### Phase 3: Development
- Implement backend services for managing learning paths and associated data operations.
- Develop frontend components for user interfaces related to learning path management.
- Integrate with existing content management and recommendation services for content suggestions.

### Phase 4: Testing
- Write and execute unit tests for backend services and frontend components.
- Conduct integration testing to ensure seamless interaction with other system components.
- Perform end-to-end testing to validate complete user workflows for creating and following learning paths.

### Phase 5: Deployment and Monitoring
- Deploy the feature to a staging environment for user acceptance testing (UAT) and feedback.
- Monitor feature performance and user engagement through analytics and logging.
- Address any issues or bugs identified during testing and initial deployment.
