# Master Test Plan for EduLibra

## Overview
This document outlines the master test plan for the EduLibra platform, including the scope, objectives, resources, and schedule for testing activities.

## Introduction
The EduLibra platform is an AI-powered digital library designed to provide personalized learning experiences. This master test plan (MTP) provides a comprehensive approach to testing the platform to ensure it meets quality standards and fulfills user requirements.

## Objectives
- Ensure that the EduLibra platform functions as intended and meets user expectations.
- Identify and resolve defects early in the development lifecycle.
- Validate that the platform complies with specified functional and non-functional requirements.
- Provide stakeholders with confidence in the quality and reliability of the platform.

## Scope
### In Scope
- Functional testing of all platform features and user workflows.
- Non-functional testing including performance, security, usability, and compatibility.
- Integration testing to verify interactions between different components and services.
- User acceptance testing to validate the platform against user expectations.

### Out of Scope
- Testing of third-party integrations beyond the control of the project team.
- Hardware compatibility testing for specific device models.

## Test Strategy
The testing strategy will encompass multiple levels and types of testing:

1. **Unit Testing:** Conducted by developers to validate individual components and functions.
2. **Integration Testing:** Focused on verifying interactions between integrated components and services.
3. **System Testing:** Comprehensive testing of the entire system to ensure compliance with requirements.
4. **User Acceptance Testing (UAT):** Involves end-users testing the platform in a production-like environment.
5. **Regression Testing:** Ensures that new changes do not adversely affect existing functionality.

## Roles and Responsibilities

| Role                  | Responsibilities                                                                     |
|-----------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Test Manager          | Oversee testing activities, manage resources, and report testing progress.          |
| Test Lead             | Lead test planning, design test cases, and coordinate testing efforts.              |
| Test Engineers        | Execute test cases, log defects, and report testing results.                        |
| Developers            | Support testing activities, fix defects, and participate in test case reviews.      |
| Business Analysts     | Provide requirements clarification and assist with user acceptance testing.         |

## Test Environment
- **Staging Environment:** Mimics the production environment and is used for integration and system testing.
- **Production-Like Environment:** Used for UAT to validate the system in a real-world setting.
- **Development Environment:** Used by developers for unit testing and initial integration checks.

## Test Deliverables
- Test plans and test cases for all levels of testing.
- Test execution reports and defect logs.
- Test closure report summarizing testing activities and outcomes.
