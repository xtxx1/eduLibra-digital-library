# Test Strategy for EduLibra

## Overview
This document describes the overall testing strategy for the EduLibra platform, outlining the approach for different levels and types of testing to ensure quality and reliability.

## Testing Approach
The testing approach for EduLibra is designed to validate both functional and non-functional requirements through a structured and phased testing process.

### Levels of Testing

1. **Unit Testing:**
   - Conducted by developers to verify the correctness of individual components and functions.
   - Automated unit tests are encouraged to ensure consistency and repeatability.

2. **Integration Testing:**
   - Focuses on verifying interactions between integrated components, services, and modules.
   - Includes API testing to validate communication and data exchange between system components.

3. **System Testing:**
   - Comprehensive testing of the complete system to validate compliance with specified requirements.
   - Encompasses functional, performance, security, and usability testing.

4. **User Acceptance Testing (UAT):**
   - Engages end-users to validate the system against real-world usage scenarios and expectations.
   - Conducted in a production-like environment to simulate actual operating conditions.

### Types of Testing

1. **Functional Testing:**
   - Validates that the system meets specified functional requirements.
   - Includes smoke testing, regression testing, and sanity testing.

2. **Non-Functional Testing:**
   - Evaluates system attributes such as performance, security, usability, and compatibility.
   - Specific tests include load testing, security vulnerability scanning, and accessibility testing.

3. **Regression Testing:**
   - Ensures that new changes or enhancements do not adversely impact existing functionality.
   - Implemented as part of continuous integration and delivery pipelines.

4. **Exploratory Testing:**
   - Encourages testers to explore the system without predefined test cases to uncover unexpected behaviors or defects.

## Test Management and Tools
- **Test Management Tool:** Use tools like TestRail or Zephyr for managing test cases, execution, and reporting.
- **Defect Tracking:** Utilize Redmine for logging, tracking, and managing defects throughout the testing lifecycle.
- **Automation Tools:** Implement automated testing tools such as Selenium, JMeter, and Postman for efficiency and coverage.

## Entry and Exit Criteria

### Entry Criteria for Testing Phases
- Test planning and test case design are complete.
- Test environments are set up and configured as per requirements.
- Development milestones are achieved, and build is available for testing.

### Exit Criteria for Testing Phases
- All planned test cases have been executed.
- All critical and major defects identified during testing are resolved or deferred with stakeholder approval.
- Test metrics (e.g., test coverage, defect density) meet predefined quality benchmarks.

## Roles and Responsibilities

| Role                  | Responsibilities                                                                     |
|-----------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Test Manager          | Define testing strategy and oversee testing activities.                             |
| Test Engineers        | Design test cases, execute tests, log defects, and report results.                  |
| Developers            | Fix defects identified during testing and participate in test reviews.              |
| Business Analysts     | Provide requirements clarification and validate user acceptance criteria.           |

## Test Environment and Data
- **Test Environment Setup:** Configure environments that closely mimic production settings for accurate testing results.
- **Test Data Management:** Utilize realistic and synthetic test data to cover various testing scenarios.
- **Environment Refresh:** Regularly update test environments to incorporate the latest code changes and configurations.
