# Test Case Design Guidelines for EduLibra

## Overview
This document provides guidelines for designing test cases for the EduLibra platform, ensuring comprehensive coverage and effective testing.

## General Guidelines

1. **Clarity and Precision:**
   - Each test case should clearly describe the scenario being tested, including preconditions, test steps, and expected results.

2. **Completeness:**
   - Test cases should cover all functional and non-functional requirements specified for the system.
   - Include positive, negative, and boundary test cases to validate system behavior under various conditions.

3. **Traceability:**
   - Ensure that each test case is traceable to specific requirements or user stories.
   - Use a unique identifier for each test case to facilitate tracking and management.

4. **Reusability:**
   - Design test cases to be reusable across different testing cycles and versions of the platform.
   - Consider modular test case design to support different testing configurations and environments.

## Functional Test Case Design

### Steps for Designing Functional Test Cases

1. **Identify Test Scenarios:**
   - Break down the functional requirements into specific test scenarios.
   - Consider user workflows and interactions with the system.

2. **Define Inputs and Expected Outputs:**
   - Specify the inputs required for each test scenario, including any test data.
   - Clearly define the expected outcomes and system responses for each test scenario.

3. **Include Edge and Boundary Cases:**
   - Design test cases to validate system behavior at boundary conditions and edge cases.
   - Consider invalid inputs, error conditions, and exceptional scenarios.

4. **Prioritize Test Cases:**
   - Prioritize test cases based on the criticality of the functionalities and potential impact on users.

## Non-Functional Test Case Design

### Steps for Designing Non-Functional Test Cases

1. **Performance Testing:**
   - Define performance metrics and benchmarks for system response times, throughput, and resource utilization.
   - Include load and stress testing scenarios to evaluate system behavior under high traffic conditions.

2. **Security Testing:**
   - Design test cases to validate system security controls and mechanisms.
   - Include penetration testing and vulnerability scanning to identify potential security risks.

3. **Usability Testing:**
   - Create test cases based on usability heuristics and accessibility standards.
   - Consider user feedback and usability testing sessions to identify areas for improvement.

4. **Compatibility Testing:**
   - Design test cases to verify system compatibility across different browsers, devices, and operating systems.
   - Include testing scenarios for different screen resolutions and orientations.

## Test Data Management

1. **Realistic and Diverse Data:**
   - Use realistic and diverse test data to uncover potential issues related to data handling and processing.

2. **Data Generation and Preparation:**
   - Implement automated data generation scripts to create large volumes of test data for performance and load testing.
   - Ensure that test data is properly anonymized and compliant with data protection regulations.

3. **Data Refresh and Cleanup:**
   - Regularly refresh test data to simulate real-world usage patterns and scenarios.
   - Implement data cleanup procedures to maintain test environment integrity and performance.
