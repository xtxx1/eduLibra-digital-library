# Test Environment Plan for EduLibra

## Overview
This document outlines the plan for setting up and configuring test environments for the EduLibra platform, ensuring accurate and reliable testing outcomes.

## Test Environment Requirements

### Hardware and Software Requirements

1. **Servers and Infrastructure:**
   - Provision virtual machines or cloud-based instances to host the test environments.
   - Configure servers with sufficient CPU, memory, and storage resources to simulate production load conditions.

2. **Operating Systems and Platforms:**
   - Utilize a mix of operating systems (Windows, macOS, Linux) to ensure compatibility testing.
   - Deploy the platform on different web servers and container environments as applicable.

3. **Database Configurations:**
   - Set up database instances (PostgreSQL, MongoDB) with realistic datasets to support functional and performance testing.
   - Implement database replication and backup procedures to ensure data integrity during testing.

4. **Network Configurations:**
   - Configure network settings to simulate production network conditions, including latency and bandwidth constraints.
   - Implement firewall rules and network security policies to validate system behavior under secure network environments.

## Test Environment Setup

### Staging Environment

1. **Purpose:**
   - The staging environment is used for integration testing, system testing, and pre-release validation.
   - It closely mimics the production environment to provide realistic testing conditions.

2. **Configuration:**
   - Deploy the latest stable build of the EduLibra platform on staging servers.
   - Configure load balancers, caching servers, and other infrastructure components to match the production setup.

3. **Data Management:**
   - Use anonymized production data or synthetic test data to populate the staging environment.
   - Implement data refresh and synchronization procedures to maintain test environment relevance.

### Development Environment

1. **Purpose:**
   - The development environment is used by developers for unit testing and debugging.
   - It provides a sandbox for isolated testing of new features and changes.

2. **Configuration:**
   - Deploy individual components or microservices as needed for development and testing.
   - Configure local instances of databases and external services for developer access.

3. **Isolation and Independence:**
   - Ensure that development environments are isolated from each other to prevent conflicts and interference.
   - Implement version control and dependency management to maintain environment consistency.

## Test Environment Management

### Environment Refresh and Maintenance

1. **Regular Updates:**
   - Schedule regular updates and maintenance windows to apply patches, updates, and configuration changes.
   - Coordinate with development and testing teams to minimize disruption to testing activities.

2. **Backup and Recovery:**
   - Implement backup and recovery procedures to protect test environment configurations and data.
   - Perform regular backups and validate recovery processes to ensure business continuity.

3. **Monitoring and Logging:**
   - Deploy monitoring and logging tools to track environment health, performance, and utilization.
   - Configure alerts and notifications to proactively identify and address issues.

## Environment Access and Security

1. **Access Control:**
   - Implement role-based access control (RBAC) to manage environment access based on user roles and responsibilities.
   - Use secure authentication mechanisms (e.g., multi-factor authentication) to protect access to test environments.

2. **Security Policies:**
   - Enforce network security policies, firewall rules, and intrusion detection systems to safeguard test environments.
   - Regularly audit and review environment configurations and access logs to detect and mitigate security risks.

3. **Data Privacy and Compliance:**
   - Ensure that all test data and environments comply with data protection regulations and industry standards.
   - Implement data anonymization and masking techniques to protect sensitive information.
