# Defect Management Process for EduLibra

## Overview
This document outlines the process for logging, tracking, and managing defects identified during the testing of the EduLibra platform.

## Defect Management Workflow

1. **Defect Identification:**
   - Test engineers identify defects during the execution of test cases or exploratory testing.
   - Defects are documented with detailed information about the observed behavior and steps to reproduce.

2. **Defect Logging:**
   - Defects are logged in the defect tracking system (e.g., Redmine) with the following information:
     - Unique defect identifier
     - Title and description of the defect
     - Steps to reproduce
     - Expected and actual results
     - Screenshots or logs if applicable
     - Severity and priority levels
     - Assigned owner and status

3. **Defect Triage:**
   - Conduct regular defect triage meetings with stakeholders to review and prioritize defects.
   - Determine the severity and impact of each defect on the system and users.
   - Assign defects to appropriate team members for resolution.

4. **Defect Resolution:**
   - Developers investigate and address defects, providing fixes and updates in a timely manner.
   - Test engineers verify fixes and update defect statuses accordingly.

5. **Defect Closure:**
   - Close defects that have been resolved and verified.
   - Maintain accurate records of defect statuses and resolutions for reporting and analysis.

## Defect Severity and Priority Levels

### Severity Levels

| Severity Level | Description                                                                                           |
|----------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Critical       | Defects that cause system crashes or complete failure of critical functionalities.                   |
| High           | Defects that severely impact system functionality or user experience but do not cause crashes.       |
| Medium         | Defects that impact non-critical functionalities or have minor effects on user experience.           |
| Low            | Cosmetic defects or issues with minimal impact on system functionality or user experience.          |

### Priority Levels

| Priority Level | Description                                                                                           |
|----------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| P1             | Highest priority defects that must be addressed immediately to prevent critical issues in production. |
| P2             | High priority defects that should be addressed as soon as possible to mitigate significant risks.    |
| P3             | Medium priority defects that can be addressed in future releases or updates.                         |
| P4             | Low priority defects that have minimal impact and can be deferred for future consideration.          |

## Defect Reporting and Communication

1. **Defect Reporting:**
   - Provide comprehensive defect reports with detailed descriptions and supporting evidence.
   - Include relevant logs, screenshots, and error messages to facilitate defect resolution.

2. **Defect Communication:**
   - Maintain open and transparent communication channels between test engineers, developers, and stakeholders.
   - Regularly update defect statuses and resolutions in the defect tracking system.

3. **Defect Metrics and Reporting:**
   - Track and report defect metrics, including defect density, resolution times, and backlog status.
   - Use defect metrics to identify trends, patterns, and areas for process improvement.

## Defect Prevention and Process Improvement

1. **Root Cause Analysis:**
   - Conduct root cause analysis for critical and recurring defects to identify underlying issues and prevent future occurrences.
   - Implement corrective actions and process improvements based on analysis findings.

2. **Continuous Improvement:**
   - Regularly review and refine the defect management process to enhance efficiency and effectiveness.
   - Incorporate lessons learned and best practices into future testing and development cycles.
