# Regression Testing Approach for EduLibra

## Overview
This document outlines the approach to conducting regression testing for the EduLibra platform. Regression testing is essential to ensure that new changes or enhancements do not adversely affect existing functionality and system stability.

## Regression Testing Objectives

1. **Validate Existing Functionality:**
   - Ensure that previously developed and tested functionalities continue to work as expected after new changes or enhancements.

2. **Identify Regression Defects:**
   - Detect and address any defects or issues introduced by recent changes or updates to the system.

3. **Maintain System Stability and Reliability:**
   - Preserve the stability and reliability of the EduLibra platform by validating critical functionalities and workflows.

## Regression Testing Scope

1. **Functional Areas:**
   - Prioritize regression testing based on functional areas impacted by recent changes.
   - Focus on core functionalities, critical workflows, and high-risk components.

2. **Integration Points:**
   - Validate interactions and integrations between different components, services, and external systems.

3. **Performance and Scalability:**
   - Conduct performance and scalability testing to ensure that system performance remains consistent and acceptable.

## Regression Testing Strategy

1. **Test Case Selection and Prioritization:**
   - Select and prioritize regression test cases based on risk assessments, impact analysis, and historical defect data.
   - Include a mix of automated and manual test cases to ensure comprehensive coverage and validation.

2. **Test Automation:**
   - Leverage test automation frameworks and tools to execute regression test cases efficiently and consistently.
   - Implement continuous integration (CI) pipelines to automate regression testing and provide rapid feedback to development teams.

3. **Test Execution and Reporting:**
   - Execute selected regression test cases on a regular basis, following new releases, updates, or changes to the system.
   - Report regression testing results, including pass/fail status, defect logs, and coverage metrics, to stakeholders and project teams.

## Regression Testing Process

1. **Identify Changes and Impact Analysis:**
   - Review recent changes, enhancements, or updates to the system to identify potential areas of impact.
   - Conduct impact analysis to prioritize regression testing efforts based on risk assessments and functional dependencies.

2. **Select and Update Regression Test Cases:**
   - Select existing test cases or create new ones to cover functionalities impacted by recent changes.
   - Update regression test cases as needed to reflect changes in system requirements, configurations, or workflows.

3. **Execute Regression Test Cases:**
   - Execute selected regression test cases on a regular basis, following a predefined schedule or trigger events (e.g., new releases, updates, or patches).
   - Utilize test automation frameworks and tools to streamline and accelerate regression testing activities.

4. **Analyze and Report Results:**
   - Analyze regression testing results to identify defects, issues, or areas of concern.
   - Report results, including pass/fail status, defect logs, and coverage metrics, to stakeholders and project teams.

5. **Address and Retest Defects:**
   - Collaborate with development teams to address and resolve any defects or issues identified during regression testing.
   - Retest fixed defects and validate that changes do not introduce new issues or impact existing functionalities.

## Regression Testing Tools and Technologies

1. **Test Automation Frameworks:**
   - Utilize test automation frameworks such as Selenium, JUnit, or TestNG to automate regression test cases and scenarios.

2. **Continuous Integration (CI) Pipelines:**
   - Implement CI pipelines using tools like Jenkins, GitLab CI/CD, or GitHub Actions to automate regression testing and integrate with development workflows.

3. **Test Management Tools:**
   - Leverage test management tools such as TestRail, Zephyr, or Redmine to manage regression test cases, execution, and reporting.

4. **Performance Testing Tools:**
   - Utilize performance testing tools such as JMeter, LoadRunner, or Gatling to conduct performance and scalability testing as part of regression testing activities.

## Conclusion

The regression testing approach for EduLibra is designed to validate existing functionality, identify regression defects, and maintain system stability and reliability. By leveraging test automation, CI pipelines, and effective test case selection and prioritization, the approach aims to ensure the delivery of a high-quality and reliable platform for our users and stakeholders.
