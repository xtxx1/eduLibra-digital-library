   - Provide clear timelines and expectations for when feedback will be addressed.

## UAT Sign-off Process

### Sign-off Criteria
1. **Completion of UAT Scenarios:**
   - All predefined UAT scenarios and test cases must be executed and validated.
   - Any deviations or issues must be documented and addressed to the satisfaction of end-users.

2. **Resolution of Critical Issues:**
   - All critical and high-priority issues identified during UAT must be resolved or acknowledged with a mitigation plan.

3. **User Acceptance:**
   - End-users and stakeholders must confirm that the platform meets their requirements and expectations.
   - Formal sign-off must be obtained from all key stakeholders and user representatives.

### Sign-off Procedure
1. **Review and Validation:**
   - Conduct a final review session with end-users and stakeholders to validate that all UAT objectives have been met.
   - Present a summary of testing activities, findings, and resolutions to obtain consensus on platform readiness.

2. **Sign-off Documentation:**
   - Prepare and circulate sign-off documentation that outlines the UAT process, results, and any outstanding issues.
   - Include statements of acceptance from key stakeholders and user representatives.

3. **Final Approval:**

   - Conduct final checks, updates, and validations to ensure readiness for production release.

2. **Communicate Deployment Plan:**
   - Communicate the deployment plan and schedule to all relevant stakeholders and end-users.
   - Provide training and support materials to facilitate a smooth transition to the production environment.

3. **Monitor Post-Deployment:**
   - Monitor the platform closely following deployment to identify and address any issues promptly.
   - Gather user feedback and performance metrics to validate the success of the deployment and identify areas for continuous improvement.
