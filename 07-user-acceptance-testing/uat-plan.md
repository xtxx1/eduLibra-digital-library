# User Acceptance Testing Plan for EduLibra

## Overview
This document outlines the plan for conducting User Acceptance Testing (UAT) for the EduLibra platform. UAT is a critical phase where end-users validate the system against their requirements and expectations.

## Objectives
- Validate that the EduLibra platform meets the business and user requirements.
- Ensure that the platform functions as expected in a real-world environment.
- Gather feedback from end-users to identify any issues or improvements before final deployment.

## Scope
### In Scope
- Testing of all core functionalities and workflows by end-users.
- Validation of platform usability, performance, and accessibility.
- Verification of integration with external systems and data sources.

### Out of Scope
- Technical performance testing (beyond user experience).
- Detailed security testing (beyond user-level security features).

## UAT Environment
- A production-like environment will be set up for UAT to closely simulate real-world conditions.
- The UAT environment will include all necessary configurations, data sets, and integrated systems.

## UAT Scenarios and Test Cases
- A set of predefined UAT scenarios and test cases will be used to guide end-users through the testing process.
- These scenarios will cover core functionalities, user workflows, and edge cases.

## Entry Criteria
- All functional and non-functional testing phases (unit, integration, system testing) must be completed.
- Major defects identified during previous testing phases must be resolved.
- The UAT environment must be set up and validated to mirror production conditions.

## Exit Criteria
- All predefined UAT scenarios and test cases have been executed.
- All critical and high-priority defects identified during UAT are resolved.
- End-users and stakeholders have signed off, indicating acceptance of the platform.

## Risk Management
- **Risk Identification:**
  - Potential delays in environment setup or data preparation.
  - Insufficient participation or engagement from end-users.
- **Mitigation Strategies:**
  - Early engagement and communication with end-users to secure commitment.
  - Regular progress reviews and status updates to address issues promptly.
