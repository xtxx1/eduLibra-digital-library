# Post-Deployment Verification for EduLibra

## Overview
This document describes the verification activities to be performed after deploying the EduLibra platform to ensure that all functionalities operate as expected in the production environment.

## Objectives
- Validate that the EduLibra platform is functioning correctly in the production environment.
- Ensure that all critical functionalities, integrations, and performance metrics meet specified requirements.
- Identify and address any issues or anomalies that arise post-deployment.

## Verification Scope

### 1. Functional Verification
- Validate core functionalities including user registration, content search and access, learning path management, and subscription management.
- Verify integration with external systems and data sources.
- Ensure all administrative and user workflows are functioning as expected.

### 2. Performance Verification
- Monitor system performance metrics including response times, throughput, and resource utilization.
- Validate that the system meets defined performance benchmarks under expected load conditions.
- Conduct stress testing to assess the system's behavior under high traffic scenarios.

### 3. Security Verification
- Verify that all security controls and mechanisms are operational and effective.
- Conduct vulnerability scans and penetration testing to identify and address potential security risks.
- Ensure compliance with data protection regulations and industry standards.

### 4. Usability and Accessibility Verification
- Validate that the platform is user-friendly, intuitive, and accessible to all users, including those with disabilities.
- Conduct user experience testing to gather feedback on usability and ease of navigation.
- Ensure compliance with accessibility standards such as WCAG 2.1.

### 5. Data Integrity and Migration Verification
- Verify that all data migrations and updates were completed accurately and without loss or corruption.
- Validate data integrity and consistency across different system components and databases.
- Ensure that data backups and recovery procedures are operational and effective.

## Verification Activities

### 1. Smoke Testing
- Conduct smoke testing to verify that critical functionalities are operational immediately after deployment.
- Address any critical issues identified during smoke testing before proceeding with further verification activities.

### 2. Functional Testing
- Execute a subset of functional test cases to validate key user workflows and system functionalities.
- Focus on testing core features, integrations, and user interactions that have the highest impact on user experience.

### 3. Performance Testing
- Monitor system performance using predefined metrics and benchmarks.
- Conduct load testing to validate system behavior under high traffic conditions.
- Address any performance bottlenecks or issues identified during testing.

### 4. Security Testing
- Conduct security scans and penetration testing to identify vulnerabilities and risks.
- Validate that all security controls such as authentication, authorization, and data encryption are operational.
- Address any security issues or vulnerabilities identified during testing.

### 5. User Acceptance Testing (UAT) Validation
- Engage end-users to validate that the platform meets their expectations and requirements.
- Gather feedback on usability, performance, and overall user experience.
- Address any issues or concerns raised by end-users during UAT validation.
