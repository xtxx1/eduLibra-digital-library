# Runbook Highlights for EduLibra

## Overview
This document provides highlights and key procedures from the operations runbook for the EduLibra platform. It serves as a quick reference guide for common operational tasks and troubleshooting procedures.

## Incident Management

### Incident Response Process
1. **Initial Report:**
   - Incident reported via monitoring system, user report, or support ticket.
   - Incident details captured and logged in the incident management system.

2. **Classification and Prioritization:**
   - Classify incident based on impact and urgency (e.g., P1, P2, P3).
   - Assign priority and escalate as necessary to appropriate response teams.

3. **Diagnosis:**
   - Conduct initial diagnosis to determine incident scope and root cause.
   - Gather relevant logs, metrics, and system information to aid diagnosis.

4. **Resolution:**
   - Implement corrective actions to resolve the incident and restore service.
   - Verify resolution effectiveness and monitor system health post-resolution.

5. **Closure:**
   - Document incident details, resolution steps, and lessons learned.
   - Close incident in the management system and communicate updates to stakeholders.

#### Common Incident Types and Responses

| Incident Type               | Symptoms                                   | Initial Diagnostic Steps                          | Resolution Procedures                          |
|-----------------------------|--------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| Platform Outages            | Unavailability of EduLibra platform        | Check server health, network status, logs.        | Restart services, restore from backup.        |
| Authentication Failures     | Users unable to log in or authenticate.    | Verify authentication service status, logs.      | Restart authentication services, verify configs.|
| Content Access Issues       | Users cannot access or view content.       | Check content service status, database.          | Restart content services, verify permissions.  |
| Performance Degradation     | Slow response times or timeouts.           | Monitor system performance metrics, logs.        | Optimize queries, scale resources as needed.  |

## Routine Maintenance Procedures

### System Backups
- **Daily Backups:**
  - Schedule daily backups of application data and configurations.
  - Verify backup integrity and completion through automated checks.

- **Backup Retention:**
  - Maintain daily backups for 30 days, weekly backups for 90 days, and monthly backups for 1 year.
  - Store backups securely with encryption and access controls.

### System Monitoring
- **Monitoring Tools:**
  - Utilize monitoring tools to track system health, performance metrics, and error logs.
  - Configure alerts and notifications for critical events and performance thresholds.

- **Log Management:**
  - Centralize and archive system logs for analysis and troubleshooting.
  - Implement log rotation and retention policies to manage storage and compliance.

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Authentication Failures

1. **Verify Configuration:**
   - Confirm authentication service configurations and database connectivity.
   - Check for any recent changes or updates that may have impacted authentication.

2. **Service Restart:**
   - Restart authentication services to clear temporary states or issues.
   - Monitor service restart and verify functionality.

### Content Access Issues

1. **Check Service Status:**
   - Verify that content management services are operational and responsive.
   - Review logs and metrics for errors or performance issues.

2. **Validate Permissions:**
   - Ensure that user permissions and access controls are correctly configured.
   - Audit permission assignments and update as necessary to resolve access issues.

3. **Content Service Restart:**
   - Restart content management services to address potential service issues.
   - Verify content accessibility and functionality post-restart.

### Performance Issues

1. **Resource Utilization:**
   - Monitor CPU, memory, and I/O usage to identify resource constraints or bottlenecks.
   - Scale resources as needed to address performance degradation.

2. **Database Optimization:**
   - Review and optimize database queries and indexes to improve performance.
   - Monitor database health and performance metrics to identify issues.

3. **Load Testing:**
   - Conduct load testing to simulate high traffic conditions and identify performance limits.
   - Implement optimizations and scaling strategies based on load testing results.

## Escalation Procedures

### Support Escalation Paths

1. **Level 1 Support:**
   - Initial point of contact for user issues and inquiries.
   - Provide basic troubleshooting and resolution for common problems.

2. **Level 2 Support:**
   - Escalation point for complex issues requiring in-depth analysis and resolution.
   - Provide advanced troubleshooting and coordination with development and operations teams.

3. **Level 3 Support:**
   - Escalation point for critical system issues and outages.
   - Coordinate with senior operations and development staff to address severe incidents and perform root cause analysis.

## Conclusion
